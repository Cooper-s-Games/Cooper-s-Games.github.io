            <p>I don't want making addons and gamemodes to be a pain. I want you to be able to make a simple C# script, load it in, and play it</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my goals</p>

<ul>

    <li>Load new code at runtime, loads in quickly</li>

    <li>Hotloads code while playing</li>

    <li>Easy to learn and start scripting</li>

    <li>You don't have to install anything other than the base game (no SDks)</li>

</ul>

            <div class="title"><a href="#Implementation">Implementation</a></div>
            <p>Please note most of this code is spaghetti, I'm still testing it.</p>

<p>How were implementing this is pretty straight forwart right now. There's a World class, a Gamemode class, and some Entity classes.</p>

<p>Here's some example code from the<a href="https://github.com/AngryMooseGames/phys-testgamemode"> github repo.</a></p>

<p>It's creating the health, killfeed, and crossair. After that it adds the UI components to your game. This should be easy to understand, that's what I'm going for. I want modders who might not be too good at programming be able to make stuff easily.</p>

    <section class="section blogentry" id="Network_Functions">
        <div class="container content">
            <div class="title"><a href="#Network_Functions">Network/client functions</a></div>
            <p>There's a [Server] attribute on functions, which means that it runs always on the server. It can be called by the client. Here's an example.</p>

<p>Just like normal functions, The engine knows if you're a client and if the function needs to be called on the server, so it sends an network message over to the server to call it!</p>

<p>They work from server to client as well.</p>

            <div class="title"><a href="#Async">Console</a></div>
            <p>In the last blog post I talked a bit about how I wanted a console in-game. I started working on it and I'm about 50% done.</p>

<p>This page gives you info for the gamemode. On the left is the gamemode json file, on the right is the stuff in the gamemode (or just currently open ingame). You can refresh to see any changes you've made.</p>

<p>Here's the main console window. You can enter commands, and eventually see logs. The only commands so far are input, which displays the keybind info, and map [mapname], which loads a map. I don't want custom commands, as I fear that might mess up the game for some players. But it might happen someday.</p>

            <p>I hope you learned a bit more about how you can make gamemodes in C#, and you're excited to start modding! I made a <a href="https://coopbjax.gitbook.io/physics/"> wiki,</a> feel free to check it out. I'll add more to it as I add more stuff, and implement more.</p>
